 Module 1 – User Input & Context Detection
Detects the user's location, lighting, time of day, and event theme using camera input, sensors, and optional user input.

 Module 2 – Environment Scene Detection
Classifies the scene (e.g., beach, café, park) using image-based scene recognition models like Places365 or ViT.

 Module 3 – Lighting & Camera Condition Estimator
Estimates ideal camera settings (ISO, white balance, exposure) using ML models based on current lighting and environment.

 Module 4 – Pose Detection & Suggestion
Uses pose estimation (e.g., MediaPipe) to detect user posture and recommends top poses suitable for the current scene.

 Module 5 – Outfit Recommendation Module
Suggests outfits and colors based on event type, weather, scene, and user preferences using CLIP or fashion matching models.

 Module 6 – Personalization Module
Learns from user preferences and behavior to refine pose and outfit recommendations over time.

 Module 7 – AI Mockup Preview Generator
Generates a visual mockup of the user in the suggested pose and outfit using generative models like Stable Diffusion.

 Module 8 – Final Output Display
Displays real-time pose overlays, outfit suggestions, camera settings, and mock previews with interactive action buttons.
